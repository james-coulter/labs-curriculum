# Module Inquiry 1

## Questions

1. What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?
    - What datasets have been successful in the past for Citrics DS teams?
    - What has NOT worked in the past?
    - What is the ideal outcome? What is the expected vision? From a functionality perspective
    - What is the main value proposition to users? Ancillary propositions?
    - What is the desired level of granularity for the data?
    - Scale? How many users should be able to use this? What is the target audience? Total Addressable Market (TAM)?
    - How many cities is too much to handle?
    - What brand, look, or feel do you have for the design of the application?
    - What are the most important call-to-actions (especially on homepage)?

2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
    - As a user, I can view the job market/outlook for the city
    - As a user, I can see typical weather patterns for the city
    - As a user, I can view the historical housing prices /rent of a city.
    
3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?
    - What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?
        - As a user, I can see typical weather patterns for the city
            - Collect data (DS)
            - Bake into main API endpoint (JSON)
            - Create and style dynamic current weather icon
            - All above features are tested and deployed
            - Display daily/ annual weather patterns in C and F degrees (toggle option)
        - We did a really good job at looking at the processes necessary for both DS and Web
        
4. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?
    - I think we did a really good job at dividing up features. I would probably just add more if I had to change anything/had more time
